# SetbackCardGame

This is a card game played by my partner's family. I thought it'd be a fun project to learn Pygame and to relearn Python and OOP fundamentals. 

Goals for this project

-Classes for Card, Decks, Players, each trick, each round
-A game file that has the rules and scoring of the game
- a text-based main file that will take input of four players
- represent the cards in pygame
- networking online
