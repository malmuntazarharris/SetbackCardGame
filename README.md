# SetbackCardGame

This is a card game played by my partner's family. I thought it'd be a fun project to learn Pygame and to relearn Python and OOP fundamentals. 

Goals for this project:

- [x] Classes for Card, Decks, Players, each trick, each round
   - [x] Card
   - [x] Deck
   - [x] Player
   - [x ] Trick
   - [ x] Round
- [ ] Rules and Scoring
- [ ] text-based main.py
- [ ] gui
- [ ] network
